I've finally decided to stop using Polybar for good and switch to [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) completely. For the moment, I just configured an almost one to one replica of my old Polybar. However, I've already began playing around with animations, revealers and other features, so this is just the beginning.

[This](https://github.com/druskus20/eugh/tree/master/polybar-replacement) is how my current config looks:

Also, [here](https://github.com/druskus20/eugh) are some of the tests I've been doing, as well as a concept for my next bar:
